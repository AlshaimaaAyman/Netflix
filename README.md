TV Shows and Movies listed on Netflix
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as
of 2019.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the
number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The
streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than
2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly
tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be
obtained from the same dataset.
